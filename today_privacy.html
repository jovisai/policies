**Privacy Policy**

"Today" app is built by Muthukrishnan for his own usage and then made public for everyone.

The app collects no data, personal or device related. Everything you add in the app including your preferences are all stored in the device itself.

There is no artificial intelligence or recommendation algorithm I am trying to build which would need me to collect any interest data of the user. 

**Log Data**

No logs are collected yet from the user device for me to do any analysis. Its a dead simple app which basically shows news based on the keywords added by you.

**Cookies**

No cookies need for this app. The API calls I make to fetch news are based on the keywords alone, so I don't need any user information.

**Security**

Technically, I am only fetching news from my servers to the application through a secure HTTPS protocol. 

**Links to Other Sites**

This app contains many links to other sites. I have taken utmost care in ensuring that I am indexing content only from good quality sources, because I use this app for my own personal use. When I find any content provider not following good security policies, I immeidately blacklist them.
If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. 

**Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

There is nothing in this app for kids below 13 years of age. 

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2023-03-15
